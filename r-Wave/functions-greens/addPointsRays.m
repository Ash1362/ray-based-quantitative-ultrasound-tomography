%ADDPOINTSRAYS adds a number of points to the end of rays using a linear
%extrapolation
%
%     DESCRIPTION:
%       addPointsRays adds a given number of points to the end point of rays using a
%       linear extrapolation. The spacing of the added points equals the ray spacing.
%       This is done for computing the derivative of the last rays' points with respect
%       to the initial angle or with respect to the arc length, because the auxilary rays
%       may have fewer points than the linked (reference) ray, and therefore, the rays'
%       Jacobian on the last points of the linked (reference) ray cannot be computed
%       without increase of points on the auxiliary rays.

%
% USAGE:
%       
%
% INPUTS:
%       ray_position             - the position of the points on the rays
%                                  in a single Cartesian coordinate
%       receiver_indices         - a vector containing the index of columns
%                                  correponding to the reception points in 
%                                  matrices containing the rays' parameters
%       num_extrapolation_points - a vector containing the number of points
%                                  must be added to the last point of each ray
%       num_ray                  - the number of rays
% OUTPUTS:
%       ray_position_extrapolated - the position of the points on the corrected rays
%                                  in a single Cartesian coordinate
