%CALCGEOMATTENUATIONJACOBIAN computes the Jacobian of rays
%
%   % DESCRIPTION:
%       calcGeomAttenuationJacobian computes the rays' Jacobian and the
%       cumulative number of caustics along the rays. The rays' Jacobian
%       will be used for computing the geometrical portion of the
%       attenuation (amplidue decay) which includes refraction effects.
%       The cumulative number of caustics along the rays determines the number
%       of pi/2 shifts must be applied to the phase on the rays' points.
