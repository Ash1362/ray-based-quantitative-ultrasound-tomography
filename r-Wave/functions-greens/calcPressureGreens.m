%CALCPRESSUREGREENS computes the pressure field on the grid points and

%
%   % DESCRIPTION:
%       calcPressureGreens computes the pressure field on the grid points
%       and receivers using the Green's function for the heterogeneous and
%       absorbing media. The parameters of the Green's function on the grid
%       points and receivers are given.
%
%
% USAGE:
%
%
% INPUTS:
%       approximate_pressure - the handle function for approximating the
%                             pressure field given a pressure source
%                             and the parameters of the Green's function
%       parameters_grid     - a matrix with rows the grid points inside
%                             the binary mask, and columns: time delays,
%                             geoemetrical attenuation including the refraction
%                             effects, acoustic absorption (if not zero),
%                             and relative sound speed (the sound speed over
%                             the sound speed in water)
%       nan_grid_binary     - a binary mask indicating to the grid
%                             points outside the given binary mask
%       pressure_source     - the pressure source
%       source_mode         - the source mode for computing the pressure
%                             field on the grids. This can be 'normal' or
%                             'time-reversal'. The method for computing
%                             pressure on the receivers is always 'normal'.
%       caustic_number      - the cumulative integer number of the caustics
%                             from the rays emanated from the emitter
%       parameters_receiver- a matrix with rows the receivers, and columns:
%                             time delays, geoemetrical attenuation including
%                             refraction effects, acoustic absorption (if not zero),
%                             and relative sound speed. If empty, the mode will be
%                             'adjoint'
%       caustic_receiver   - the cumulative times the sign of the rays'
%                            Jacobian has been changed before the ray is
%                            intercepted by the reception point.
%       receiver_order     - a vector indicating the order of the receivers in
%                             the variable 'parameters_receiver'.
%       num_frequency      - the number of frequencies
%
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       pressure_grid     - the pressure field on the grid points
%       pressure_receiver - the pressure field on the receivers (if the
%                            mode is 'forward')
