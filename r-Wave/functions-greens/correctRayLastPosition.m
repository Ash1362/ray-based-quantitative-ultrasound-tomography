%CORRECTRAYLASTPOSITION makes the last ray spacing just before the reception point
%the same as the ray spacing along the ray
%
%   % DESCRIPTION:
%       correctRayLastPosition moves the last point on the ray forward, i.e.,
%       the reception point forward so that the spacing between the reception
%       point and the ray's point just before that be equal to the ray spacing
%       along the ray

% USAGE:
%
%
% INPUTS:
%       ray_position_x        - the x cartesian position of the points on the rays
%       ray_position_y        - the y cartesian position of the points on the rays
%       ray_position-z        - the z cartesian position of the points on the rays
%       ray_spacing           - the ray spacing [m]
%       auxiliary_ray         - Boolean determining the ray is auxiliary or not
% OUTPUTS:
%       ray_position_x        - the corrected x cartesian position of the points on the rays
%       ray_position_y        - the corrected y cartesian position of the points on the rays
%       ray_position-z        - the corrected z cartesian position of the points on the rays
%       nan_binary            - the binary mask, which is true for the
%                               ray's point outside a chosen binary mask.
%       receiver_indices      - a vector containing the index of columns
%                               correponding to the reception points in
%                               matrices containing the rays' parameters,
%                               eg. ray_poition_x
