%CALCRAYLINKFORWARDFULLWAVE traces a ray and calculates the information

%
% DESCRIPTION:
% calRayLinkForwardFullWave traces a ray and calculates the information
% about the end point of the ray. In other words, this function solves the
% forward operators for iteratvely solving the inverse problem of ray
% linking. Only for the linked (optimal ray after ray linking),
% this function computes the accumulated parameters along the rays, as well
% as the information required for computing the geometerical attenuation.
