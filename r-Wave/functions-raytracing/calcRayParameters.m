% USAGE:

%
% INPUTS:
%       refractive            - disretised refractive index
%       ray_fields_params - a struct with fields the direction gradients
%                           for an interpolation using a'Bilinear'
%                           approach, or parameters for choosing indices of
%                           the grid points and their associated coefficients for an
%                           interpolation using a 'Bspline' approach.
%                           The fields are:

%       'refractive_gradient_y' - discretised refractive index gradient along y
%       'refractive_gradient_z' - discretised refractive index gradient along z
%                              using a'Bspline' interpolation, this
%                              includes the matrices for intertpolation:

%                                 gradientsof the field
%       cartesian_position_emitter - a dim x 1 cartesian position of the emitter
%       polar_direction_receiver   - a (dim-1) x 1 vector of the polar direction from emitter to
%                                    receiver
%       polar_initial_direction    - a (dim-1) x 1 vector of the polar initial
%                                    direction of the ray
%       xvec                 - the x vector of grid points
%       yvec                 - the y vector of grid points
%       zvec                 - the z vector of grid points
%       pos_grid_first       - a dim x 1 Cartesian position of the first index of
%                               the grid
%       pos_grid_end         - a dim x 1 Cartesian position of the end index of
%                              the grid
%       dx                   - a scalar representing the grid spacing, the same
%                              along all the Cartesian coordinates [m]
%       ds                   - a saclar representing the ray spacing [m]
%       grid_size            - the size of the grid
%       dim                  - the dimension of the medium
%       mask                 - a binary mask used for calculating the
%                              interpolation coefficients                             
%       calc_coeffs          - a boolean controlling whether the
%                              interpolation coefficients are stored or
%                              not (This is often set true only for a linked
%                              ray after solving the ray linking problem.)
%       raylink_method     -  method for ray linking. For 2D case, this can be
%                              'Regula-Falsi' or 'Secant', and for 3D case, this
%                              can be 'Quasi-Newton'. 'Regula-Falsi' converges
%                              well with initial guess far from true, but it
%                              converges solwly. 'Secant' and 'Quasi-Newton'
%                              are fast, but converge badly for initial guesses
%                              far from true, and are therefore used
%                              through iteratively reconstruction of the
%                              sound speed, where the linked ray for each
%                              iteration is used as initial guess for ray
%                              linking for the next iteration.
%       raytracing_method   - the method for ray tracing, which can be
%                             'Mixed-step', 'Dual-update', 'Characteristics',
%                             or 'Runge-kutta-2nd'.
