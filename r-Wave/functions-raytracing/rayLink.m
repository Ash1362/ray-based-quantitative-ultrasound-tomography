%RAYLINK constructs the system matrix for a single emitter
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%           rayLink first computes the ray which links a single emitter to 
%           each receiver. This is done via solving the inverse problem of ray
%           linking, i.e., iteratively adjusting the initial direction of the
%           ray until the interception of the ray with the detection sutface (ring) 
%           matches the centre of the receiver within a tolerance. The ray-to-grid
%           interpolation coefficients along the linked ray (the optimal ray after
%           solving the ray linking inverse problem) will then form a row
%           of sparse matrix. This function is run for each emitter
%           separately.
