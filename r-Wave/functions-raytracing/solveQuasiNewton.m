%methods
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% solveQuasiNewton solves the ray linking inverse problem using Quasi-Newton
% methods. This approach, which is used only for ray linking in 3D case,
% solves the inverse problem of ray linking in the form of a nonlinear system
% of equations using derivative-free method.
% USAGE:
%
%
% INPUTS:
%      solve_ray                - the function handle for solving the ray and the
%                                 parameters associated with the end point of the ray
%      polar_direction_receiver - the dim-1 x 1 polar direction of the straight line
%                                 connecting emitter to receiver
%      polar_direction_initial_guess - the dim-1 x 1 initial guess for the polar initial direction of
%                                       the ray. 
%      varepsilon                - stopping tolerance for ray linking                              
%      max_iter                  - the maximum number of iterations for ray linking
%      res_initial_guess         - the dim-1 x 1 residual obtained for the end point of the ray initialised
%                                 by the initial guess for the polar direction

% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%      Method                   - the Quasi-Newton approach used for ray
%                                 linking (default : 'Good-Broyden')
%      initial_derivative       - first derivative of the end point of the
%                                 ray with respect to the initial polar
%                                 direction of the ray. This can be an
%                                 identity matrix ('identity'), or computed 
%                                 using finite diferences using a large
%                                 perturbation for ensuring the stability
%                                 ('finite-difference')
%                                 (default : 'finite-difference')

%                                 
% OUTPUTS:
%       interp_coeff_vec         - interpolation coefficients for the grid
%                                  points inside the mask
%       polar_initial_direction -  dim-1 x 1 optimal polar initial direction
%                                  unit vector from emitter to the receiver
%       cartesian_pos_endpoint   - dim x 1 vector of the Cartesian position of the
%                                  end point of the ray
%       num_rays                 - the number of rays for solving the ray
%                                  linking inverse problems
