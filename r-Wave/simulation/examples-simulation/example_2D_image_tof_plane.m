% The Green's inversion approach used in 2 was used in 1 as the benchmark.
% In this example, the approach taken for ray tracing and computing the
% geomterical portion of the amplitudes for both Green's inversion approach
% is based on paraxial ray tracing. (See Algorithm 1 in [1])

%  SIMULATION (OR LOAD) OF UST DATA USING K-WAVE AND INITIAL GUESS
%==========================================================================
% This example first simulates (or loads) two ultrasound data sets, one for
% breast inside water and another for only water. 16 line arrays are placed
% on the periphery of a crircle, and 16 transducers are placed on each line array.
% In contrast with 'example_2d_image_tof_greens_circle.m', for each emitter,
% the ray linking for each receiver array is done seprately using its
% specific line equation. This script will then compute
% the time-of-flights of the UST time series using an approach called 
% Akaike-information-criterion. A sound speed image is then reconstructed
% from the time-of-flights using few iterations of a time-of-flight-based
% algorithm. Using the time-of-flight-based image reconstruction, each linearised
% subproblem is solved using 'SART' inner iterations. (cf. section 6.3.1 in [1].)
% For construction of the system matrix associated with each linearisation in
% the time-of-flight-based image reconstruction approach, the ray tracing can
% be done using the four algorithms analysed in the 'example_fish_eye.m' in
% this toolbox, but the 'Runge-kutta-2nd' was used in the papers [1] and [2],
% and this example. It is recommended that 'Runge-kutta-2nd' is used for
% time-of-flight-based image recinstruction in 2D.

% DIGITAL PHANTOM AND K-WAVE
%==========================================================================
% The Breast is simulated using a digital breast phantom developed by the group
% of Professor Mark Anastasio [3]. The phantom data must be downloaded via:'...
% https://anastasio.bioengineering.illinois.edu/downloadable-content/oa-breast-database/ [3].
% The synthetic UST pressure times series used in this study are simulated using the k-Wave
% toolbox. www.k-Wave.org (v. 1.3. or 1.4.) [4].
% It was shown in [5] that corrections must be applied on the step for 
% inclusion of source in the k-Wave to simulate the UST signals matching
% the Green's formula, considering that the solution to the wave equation
% is unique. To avoid changing the open-source k-Wave toolbox, the pressure time
% series measured by the k-Wave are kept unchanged, but the inverse of the
% required corrections was applied on the exciation pulse used as input to the
% Green's formulae. Both are equivalent, and they will affect only our assumption
% about the excitation pulse used in our simulation study.
