% Example for validation of ray approximation to Green's function
% in approximating phase and amplitude [1] (cf. section References)
%..........................................................................
% The scenario is based on section 6.2. ❝Numerical validation of the ray approximation
% to the Green’s function❞ in [1]
%
% The approach taken for computing the geomterical portion of the amplitudes
% is based on paraxial ray tracing. (cf. Algorithm 1 in [1])

% SIMULATION (OR LOAD) OF UST DATA USING K-WAVE
%==========================================================================
% This example first simulates (or loads) two ultrasound data after excitation
% of a single emitter, one for only water and another for the breast in water.
% The simulated data were recorded on all receivers. The simulations were
% performed on a grid with spacing 0.4 mm using the k-Wave toolbox [4]. For the
% breast-in-water data, the sound speed and absorption coefficient maps are 
% smoothed by an averaging window of size 17 grid points. The absorption and
% dispersion are accounted for based on a frequency-power law. The pressure
% time series simulated on the receivers are then decomposed into phase and
% amplitude using a Fourier transform operator.

%%=========================================================================
% GREEN'S FORMULA IN HOMOGENEOUS MEDIA (ONLY WATER)
%==========================================================================
% The homogeneous Green's function will then be used for approximating pressure
% field on all receivers after excitation of the chosen single emitter and
% propagation of the pressure field in only water. The approximated pressure
% field on all receivers are compared to the pressure time series simulated by
% the k-Wave in terms of phase and amplitude at the single frequency 1MHz.

%%=========================================================================
% RAY APPROXIMATION TO GREEN'S FORMULA IN HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA (BREAST-IN-WATER)
%==========================================================================
% The ray approximation to heterogeneous Green's function using ray tracing
% will then be used for approximating pressure field on all receivers after
% excitation of the chosen single emitter and propagation of the pressure field
% in the breast in water. The approximated pressure field on all receivers
% is compared to the pressure time series simulated by the k-Wave in terms of
% phase and amplitude at the single frequency 1MHz. Using the Green's approach,
% the amplitudes on the receivers are plotted before and after accounting
% for the acoustic absorption based on the frqeuency power law. Using the Green's
% approach, the dispersion is accounted for in computing the wrapped phases on
% receivers.
% It is highly recommended that papers [1] and [2], especially the details
% given in the section ❝Numerical results❞ in [1], are carefully read by the users.

% DIGITAL BREAST PHANTOM AND K-WAVE
%==========================================================================
% The Breast is simulated using a digital breast phantom developed by
% Mark Anastasio group [3]. The phantom data must be downloaed via the link:...
% https://anastasio.bioengineering.illinois.edu/downloadable-content/oa-breast-database/ [3].
% The pressure fied  used as the benchmark is simulated using the k-Wave
% toolbox. www.k-Wave.org (v. 1.3. or 1.4.) [4].
% It was shown in [5] that corrections must be applied on the step for 
% inclusion of source in the k-Wave to simulate the UST signals matching
% the Green's formula, considering that the solution to the wave equation
% is unique. To avoid changing the open-source k-Wave toolbox, the pressure time
% series measured by the k-Wave are kept unchanged, but the inverse of the
% required corrections was applied on the exciation pulse used as input to the
% Green's formulae. Both are equivalent, and they will affect only our assumption
% about the excitation pulse used in our simulation study.
