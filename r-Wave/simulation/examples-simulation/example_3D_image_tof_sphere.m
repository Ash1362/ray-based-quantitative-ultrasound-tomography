% SIMULATION (OR LOAD) OF UST DATA USING K-WAVE
%==========================================================================
% Two ultrasound data sets, one for breast inside water and another for only water,
% were simulated based on the scenarios in section 5.2-5.5 in [1]. The simulation of
% the two only-water and breast-in-water data sets using the k-Wave [4] on a grid with
% grid spacing 0.5mm took a week on 8 GPUs. Therefore, for the 3D case, the data were
% already simulated and time-of-flights were computed using a first-arrival picking
% algorithm called ❝Akaike information criterion❞. The time-of-flight data are available
% at zenodo.org.

%%=========================================================================
% RAY TRACING 
%==========================================================================
% This script will then compute an image of the sound speed from time-of-flights of
% two simulated only-water and breast-in-water ultrasoud time series. 
% For construction of the system matrix associated with each linearisation
% in the time-of-flight-based image reconstruction, ray tracing algorithms
% described in section 3 in [1] and ray linking algorithm described in section 4
% in [1] were used.
% For ray tracing, the user can choose between ray tracing algorithms:
% 1- 'Dual-update' (section 3.3.1 in [1])
% 2- 'Mixed-step' (section 3.3.2. i [1])
% 3- 'Charactersitics' (section 5.1, Eq. (54) in [2])
% 4 -'Rung-kutta-2nd' (section 5.1, Eq (54) using Algorithm 2 in [2])
% ([3] and [4] were added after publishing the paper [1].

%%=========================================================================
% RAY-TO-GRID/GRID-TO-RAY INTERPOLATION
%==========================================================================
% 1- 'Bilinear' (section 3.4. in [1])
% 2- 'Bspline' (section 5.3. in [2])

% 'Bspline' is more accurate than 'Bilinear', but it will make ray tracing slower.
% 'Bilinear' was used for implementation on the Pammoth system, but 'Bspline' was used
% as default in this simulation example.
%%=========================================================================
% RAY LINKING 
%==========================================================================
% For ray linking, the user is limited to the best algorithm in the paper.
% The chosen ray linking algorithm uses a Quasi-Newton algorithm based on a
% derivative-free ❝Broyden❞ approach. 

%%=========================================================================
% IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION
%==========================================================================
% For image reconstruction, the objective function, which is an L2 norm of
% the discrepancy of the time-of-flights associated with the breast-in-water
% and only-water data is iteratively linearised, and each linearised subproblem
% is solved using either 'sart', or 'conjugate_gradient' algorithms. These
% algorithms converge faster then the steepest descent, and require only 5
% inner iterations for soving each linearised subproblem.  (default: 'sart')
% The image reconstruction algorithm is terminated after 12 linearisations.
% Compared to the paper, it was decided that each linearised subproblem is
% solved using few early iterations, but the total number of linearsiations
% is increased. This adjusment for the number of iterations was done based
% on the experience from the experimental data measured from the Pammoth system.
% Using few number of iterations for solving each linearised subroblem acts
% implicitly as regularisation, and will reduce the artefact.
