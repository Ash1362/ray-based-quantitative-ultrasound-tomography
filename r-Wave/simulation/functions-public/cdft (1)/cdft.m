function [amp, pha]= cdft(data, f, delt_t, wyn)
% Discrete Fourier transform (dft) on the specified frequency, not fft
%
%Input:     data:   recorded time-series data
%           f:      frequency (Hz) at which one wants to do the spectral
%                   analysis
%           delt_t: time increment (s, second) between two neighbouring data
%                   point. delt_t is related to the sampling rate, e.g. if
%                   the total data collection time is T, and the length of
%                   data is n, then delt_t = T/(n - 1).
%           wyn:    'y' -- windowing on data
%                   'n' -- no windowing applied
%Output:    amp:    amplitude of the signal
%           pha:    phase (radian) of the signal
