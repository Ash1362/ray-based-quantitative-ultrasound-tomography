SHORT TERM
- finish rotating sensor unit test
- unit tests for the makeCart functions
- plotting for other element shapes
- add point source option
- get rid of 'BLITolerance' set to zero warning (only if optional input is given)
- error checking for 3D elements when axisymmetric

MAKE CART
- check Elliott note
- unit test to check positions and numbers of elements

MEDIUM TERM
- add getElementBinaryMask method
- add additional error checking for the inputs to methods
- do something with the "active" property
- function to check all elements lie within kgrid? Show a warning if the
  mask is on the edge
- consider how to store source signal when passing to k-Wave? Could the
  source signal have different types, incorporating CW? How to know what
  type of source this corresponds to (pressure, velocity, boundary
  conditions, etc)
- something to incorporate the transducer bandwidth automatically?
